    Configure backup strategy
●    Environment Management:
    Create separate compose files for dev/staging/prod
    Use .env files for configuration
    Implement secrets management
●    Networking:
    Create custom bridge networks
    Implement service discovery
    Configure port mapping properly
●    Monitoring:
    Add logging configuration
