Assignment 4: Disaster Recovery and Backup Strategy
Topics Covered: AWS Backup, S3 Replication, RDS Snapshots, Route 53 Failover, CloudFormation StackSets
Scenario:
Implement a comprehensive disaster recovery solution for multi-region deployment.
Requirements:
●    Backup Strategy:
    Configure AWS Backup for EC2, EBS, RDS, and DynamoDB
    Create backup plans with different retention policies
    Test restore procedures
●    Multi-Region Setup:
    Deploy infrastructure in two regions (primary + DR)
    Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
    Set up RDS read replica in DR region
●    Data Replication:
    Enable DynamoDB Global Tables
    Configure RDS automated snapshots and cross-region copy
    Implement S3 versioning and lifecycle policies
●    Failover Mechanism:
    Configure Route 53 failover routing policy
    Set up health checks for both regions
    Document RTO and RPO
●    Testing:
    Simulate regional failure
    Perform failover to DR region
    Document recovery time
    Test failback procedures
●    Automation:
    Create Lambda function for automated snapshot management
    Use CloudFormation StackSets for multi-region deployment
    Implement EventBridge rules for backup monitoring
●    Deliverables:
    DR plan documentation (RTO/RPO objectives)
    Backup and recovery runbook
    Failover testing report
    Cost analysis for DR setup
