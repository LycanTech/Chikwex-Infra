Assignment 3: Serverless Microservices Architecture
Topics Covered: Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SQS, SNS, EventBridge, Step Functions
Scenario:
Build a serverless order processing system for an e-commerce platform.
Requirements:
●    API Layer:
    Create REST API using API Gateway
    Implement endpoints: POST /orders, GET /orders/{id}, GET /orders
    Configure request validation and API keys
    Enable CORS
●    Business Logic:
    Create Lambda functions for:
     
Order creation (validate, save to DynamoDB)
Order processing (check inventory, process payment)
Order notification (send email/SMS),
Implement proper error handling and retries,
,
●    Data Layer:
    Design DynamoDB table with proper partition and sort keys
    Enable DynamoDB Streams
    Implement GSI for querying by status
●    Asynchronous Processing:
    Use SQS queue for order processing
    Configure DLQ for failed messages
    Implement SNS topic for order notifications (fan-out)
●    Orchestration:
    Create Step Functions state machine for order workflow:
    Validate order → Process payment → Update inventory → Send notification
    Handle failures with retry logic and compensating transactions
●    Observability:
    Enable X-Ray tracing
    Configure CloudWatch Logs with log insights queries
    Create custom metrics
●    Deliverables:
    SAM or Serverless Framework template
    API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
    Architecture diagram showing event flow
    Testing results with Postman/curl
